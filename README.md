# Multiple testing
This is a final project about several multiple testing and inference problems for Capital Bikeshare data.

In this project, we explore the following questions:

* What is the impact of the factors included in our datasets on the ride duration? Is there any spatial impact on the results?
* With all the factors we have, which are significantly influencing the bicycle demand in Washington, D.C.? Can we implement any selection inference/post-selection inference on the model?
* Prediction on bicycle demands in Washington, D.C.
